# 🌿 Raysearcher AI - Core

> *“Where Science Serves Society.”*  
> — Inspired by Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray (1861–1944)

---

## 🌞 Introduction

**Raysearcher AI** is a tribute-driven initiative inspired by **Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray**, the father of modern Indian chemistry.  
He believed that *“the highest function of science is to serve humanity.”*  

**Raysearcher-AI Core** represents the **central intelligence layer** of this ecosystem —  
an orchestration engine designed to integrate diverse research agents into one unified reasoning system.

This repository introduces the **vision, structure, and guiding principles** of Raysearcher AI — where discovery meets duty, and knowledge flows with purpose.

## ⚛️ Concept Overview

**Raysearcher AI** is an experimental framework that brings together multiple intelligent components:

| Module | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🧠 **Core** | The orchestrator — manages communication, reasoning flow, and data synchronization across agents. |
| 📥 **Data Ingestion** | Handles collection, transformation, and enrichment of research data. |
| 🔗 **Graph Agent** | Builds and queries knowledge graphs for contextual and explainable discovery. |
| 🧭 **Vector Agent** | Powers semantic retrieval and vector-based reasoning. |

The **Core** acts as the “mind” — ensuring these agents collaborate ethically, efficiently, and transparently, much like a network of thoughtful researchers.

## 🧩 Vision

Raysearcher AI aims to explore how **AI research systems** can embody the values of:
- **Scientific Integrity** — every insight is transparent, reproducible, and verified.  
- **Social Responsibility** — research outputs are evaluated for societal benefit.  
- **Education & Accessibility** — science is simplified, shared, and democratized.  
- **Interdisciplinary Fusion** — uniting chemistry, data, philosophy, and culture.

## 🧠 Core Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|------------|----------|
| **Anweshan (অন্বেষণ)** | Curiosity — the drive to explore. |
| **Satya (সত্য)** | Truth — the foundation of every discovery. |
| **Seva (সেবা)** | Service — the purpose of knowledge. |
| **Samanwaya (সমন্বয়)** | Integration — unity of systems and sciences. |
